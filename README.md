# YaserAltaiy-CarMarket Project
### Final Project Harvard CS50 Course 
This project has been done to apply all features I learned from this course implementing HTML5, CSS, 
JavaScript(DOM) Python, and Database. Working on this project helps to learn a lot of new things that 
go into building a website.

The project video is: 

## Pages Build
* Register page
* Login Page 
* Home page
* Display page
* New Post page

* Watchlist page
* contact page

## Functionalities Added

## Tech Stack 
* HTML-5

* JS-DOM

* Python (backend)
* Models (database)

## Distinctiveness and Complexity
he home page has a lot of features when we click on the user icon in the navbar , it will move us to login page.

from login page we can go to register page if we don't have account.

there is search box for searching about details in the posts we want.

any user can add new post and he is only how can delete it.

any user can write comment on the posts.

you can see all CarWashing locations near by you, and you can add new one if you have.

you can add the posts you want to WatchList or remove from WatchList.

user can contact us by sending a message.

In terms of complexity, I used Django with more than one model and javascript file to the frontend.

Moreover, all of the website is responsive to the different screen sizes (mainly mobile phones and computers).

The webite has been designed with figma, and the design then has been implemented with html, css, js, and bootstrap.

## Files information
* In views.py there is all of the backend code. The main functions are:
   - index with all the posts obtained from the database.
   - search for searching about details in the posts we want.
   - login, logout and register for user.
   - mypost for showing all my posts.
   - newpost to show newpost page.

* Make sure to create a new superuser and fill the website content through admin dashboard
